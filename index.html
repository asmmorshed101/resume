    <section class="about">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I enjoy building web applications and am always eager to learn new web-based technologies with a deep interest in cloud computing.  I have hands-on experience working with Laravel, Node.js, and Next.js to build modern websites and web applications. Currently, I am studying for a Master’s degree in Digital Transformation Technology at Soongsil University in South Korea, supported by the KOICA Scholarship.</p>

      <p>In addition to web development, I am skilled in using Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host and manage secure, reliable, and scalable web applications. I’ve worked with AWS tools like VPC, EC2, and Load Balancer. I am actively building my skills in cloud computing and DevOps. I enjoy working across the entire development cycle — from coding to deployment and infrastructure management. I have hands-on experience with AWS and am learning tools like Docker and Terraform to automate deployments and manage infrastructure as code. My focus is on improving system reliability and automating development workflows. I aim to become a skilled DevOps engineer who can effectively connect development and operations for faster, more reliable software delivery.</p>
